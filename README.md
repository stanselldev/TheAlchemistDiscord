# TheAlchemistDiscord
This is a Discord Bot Game with the premise being you are a fantasy beginner alchemist. You would start time instances for any action you do. 
For instance, if you wanted to go and gather some resources, you would start the INSTANCE and a timer would start. Once that timer is up,
you would get a random roll (with a weighted clamp) of resources.  You could then use those resources to research or build new things to help
you progress. Its basically an idle game through the Discord UI.
